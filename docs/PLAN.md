# Compose Hot Reload for Android — Project Plan

## Status (2026-07-16) — release 0.1.6 shipped end-to-end (Marketplace + tag + JitPack + Release)

T01–T28 and the full T33 project-agnostic roadmap (phases 1–10) are done and **merged to `main`
(PR #19, `f674233`)**. The product works end-to-end (body edits, structural adds, multi-module,
resources incl. bitmaps, ~22 ms live literals, interpreter for removals/hierarchy/**signature
changes** incl. composables via lambda proxies, zero-touch `hotreload start`, IDE plugin with
discovery/profiles, doctor, e2e 15/15). The IntelliJ/Android Studio plugin **0.1.6 is approved
and live on the JetBrains Marketplace**, and **release 0.1.6 is fully shipped**: git tag `0.1.6`,
GitHub Release (signed plugin zip, marked latest), and JitPack serving all three artifacts at
0.1.6 (verified by real resolution). Engineering is feature-complete; next up is a live
production-code trial (findings → T37), plus optional housekeeping + one cosmetic follow-up (T36).
Remaining items are optional housekeeping (see below). This table is the ONE canonical roadmap —
update it here, link it elsewhere.

MERGED (PR #21 squash → `9d8e42c`) |
| T36 | Cosmetic: IntelliJ renders notification bodies as HTML and collapses `\n` line breaks (the preflight "Fix these…" sentence runs onto the last bullet) → use `<br>` | tiny | 📋 QUEUED — `tasks/T36-notification-html-linebreaks.md`; bundle into the next version bump |

All engineering is DONE. Remaining items are optional housekeeping, none blocking:
- **Release provenance:** ✅ DONE 2026-07-16 — tag `0.1.6` cut on `main` (PR #23 version bumps),
  GitHub Release 0.1.6 with the signed plugin zip (marked latest), JitPack serves all three
  artifacts at 0.1.6 (verified by real resolution from a scratch project). Intermediate versions
  0.1.1→0.1.5 remain untagged by design (Marketplace-only iterations).
- **PatchServer wedge robustness:** re-arm `soTimeout` between sessions (long-standing nice-to-have).
- Stretch item 4 above (Compose N-1 shims, suspend-lambda proxies) if the project is extended.

## Context

Jetpack Compose has no true hot reload on Android. JetBrains' [compose-hot-reload](https://github.com/jetbrains/compose-hot-reload) works only on desktop JVM targets because it depends on the JetBrains Runtime's enhanced class redefinition (DCEVM, `-XX:+AllowEnhancedClassRedefinition`) — Android's ART runtime has no equivalent. Android Studio's Live Edit is limited (function-body edits, fragile, IDE-locked). The only Android solution today is [HotSwan](https://hotswan.dev/), which is paid and closed source.

**Goal:** an open-source, Flutter-style hot reload for Jetpack Compose on real Android devices/emulators: save a `.kt` file → UI updates in ~1s with app state preserved — **with zero modifications to existing application code** (a Gradle plugin wires everything into debug builds automatically). Target: Android 11+ (API 30) dev devices, debuggable builds only (a hard ART requirement, same as HotSwan/Live Edit). Public OSS project.

**Decisions already made with the user:**
- v1 is a **CLI daemon** (`hotreload watch`); IDE plugin is a later phase reusing the same engine.
- Minimum device API for hot-reload sessions: **API 30** (Android 11), because ART's *structural class redefinition* (add methods/fields) only exists there.
- Public OSS → design a version-shim boundary for Compose runtime internals from the start, but the first milestones pin one Kotlin/Compose/AGP version.
- **Not** server-driven UI. Real compiled code runs on device.

## How this is technically possible (research summary)

This is exactly how HotSwan works (confirmed from their docs) and every primitive is publicly available:

1. **ART JVMTI agent** — On debuggable apps (API 26+), a native agent `.so` can be loaded into the app process via `android.os.Debug.attachJvmtiAgent(...)` (called from a debug-only library at startup) or `adb shell am attach-agent`. JVMTI on ART supports `RedefineClasses` (method-body swaps) and, on **API 30+**, the **structural redefinition extension** (`RedefineClassesStructurally`): add new methods and fields (initialized to 0/null); cannot remove members or change existing signatures. Existing object instances survive the swap — the next call uses new method bodies. This is the state-preservation magic: no objects are recreated, so ViewModels, `remember{}`, navigation stacks all survive.
2. **Compose recomposition hooks** — The Compose *runtime* (app-side library, not framework, so no hidden-API restrictions; internals reachable via reflection):
   - `androidx.compose.runtime.Recomposer.Companion` / internal function `invalidateGroupsWithKey(key: Int)` — invalidates all composition groups with a given group key and triggers targeted recomposition. This is what Live Edit calls after a swap.
   - `androidx.compose.runtime.HotReloader` (internal, used by JetBrains CHR and Compose desktop) — `saveStateAndDispose()` / `loadStateAndCompose()`: full composition reset that preserves `rememberSaveable`. Fallback tier.
   - The Compose **compiler** emits `androidx.compose.runtime.internal.FunctionKeyMeta` annotations (flag: `generateFunctionKeyMetaAnnotations`/`liveLiterals` family of plugin options) mapping each composable function → its recomposition group key. This is how we know *which* group key to invalidate for a changed function.
3. **Google's machinery is open source (Apache-2.0)** — AOSP [`platform/tools/base/deploy`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/base/+/studio-master-dev/deploy/) contains Android Studio's entire Apply Changes / Live Edit stack: the `Deployer` (dex diffing against installed APK), the **native JVMTI agent** (`deploy/agent/native`), the installer, and the **LiveEditInterpreter** (ASM-based bytecode interpreter + "Primer" trampolines used for structural changes). We adapt this rather than writing a JVMTI agent from scratch. This is the single biggest de-risker of the project.
4. **Live Literals compiler mode** — Compose compiler's `liveLiterals` option turns constants into `MutableState`-backed providers keyed by file/offset; constants can then be patched over the wire in <50ms without any class redefinition. This is HotSwan's "literal fast path".
5. **Lambdas** — changed lambda captures alter synthesized class shapes, so redefinition fails; Live Edit's answer (and ours): load changed lambdas as brand-new classes via `InMemoryDexClassLoader` injected as a parent/companion of the app classloader, and point the swapped calling code at them.

### Why each edit type works (change classifier matrix)

| Edit | Mechanism | Latency |
|---|---|---|
| Constant literal (color, dp, string in code) | Live Literals patch over socket | <50 ms |
| Composable/function body change | JVMTI `RedefineClasses` + `invalidateGroupsWithKey` | <1 s |
| New composable/function/field in existing class | Structural redefinition (API 30+) + recompose | <1 s |
| New class / changed lambda | New dex via `InMemoryDexClassLoader` + redefine call sites | <1 s |
| Reordering composable calls, changed group structure | Redefine + composition reset tier (`HotReloader`) | ~1 s |
| XML resources (strings/colors/dimens) | `processDebugResources` → resource APK → swap via `ResourcesManager` reflection (as AOSP deployer does) → activity recreate if needed | 1–3 s |
| Signature changes, removed members, inline-function edits, hierarchy changes | **Detected by classifier → automatic fallback** to normal incremental build+install, hot reload resumes on next edit (HotSwan v1 behavior; interpreter closes this gap in Phase 6) | normal build |

## Architecture — five components (mirrors HotSwan)

        Gradle plugin: wires client lib into debug variant, sets Compose compiler
        flags, captures baseline class checksums, exposes module/classpath metadata
```

1. **`gradle-plugin`** (Kotlin, published to Maven) — the only thing users add (`id("...hotreload") version ...` in the app module or settings plugin for zero-touch). Debug-variant-only. Responsibilities: add `runtime-client` dependency to `debugImplementation`; pass Compose compiler options (`generateFunctionKeyMetaAnnotations=true`, later `liveLiterals`); register a `hotReloadSnapshot` task capturing per-class checksums + the function-key-meta map after each full build; write a `hotreload-metadata.json` per module (classpath, source dirs, applied Compose compiler version) consumed by the CLI.
2. **`runtime-client`** (Android AAR, debug only) — auto-initializes via `androidx.startup.Initializer` declared in its own manifest (this is what satisfies the "millions of LOC, zero edits" constraint — manifest merging injects it). Loads the bundled JVMTI agent from `nativeLibraryDir` via `Debug.attachJvmtiAgent`. Runs a `LocalServerSocket` (`localabstract:hotreload_<pkg>`) speaking a length-prefixed protobuf/flatbuffer protocol: `SwapRequest(dex bytes, class names, structural?)`, `LiteralUpdate(key, value)`, `InvalidateGroups(keys)`, `ResourceSwap(resApk)`, `Ping/Capabilities`. Contains the **Compose bridge**: a `ComposeVersionShim` interface with per-runtime-version implementations resolved by reflection at startup (detect `androidx.compose.runtime` version from classpath), implementing the three-tier invalidation chain: (1) `invalidateGroupsWithKey` targeted; (2) `HotReloader` save/dispose/recompose reset; (3) activity recreation.
3. **`agent`** (C++ NDK `.so`, packaged in `runtime-client` jniLibs) — adapted from AOSP `deploy/agent/native`. Exposes JNI entry points to the runtime-client: `redefineClasses(name→bytes[])`, `redefineStructurally(...)`, capability query. Keep it thin; all policy lives in Kotlin.
4. **`cli`** (Kotlin/JVM, distributed as a jar/`brew`-able launcher: `hotreload watch [--app :app] [--device serial]`) — the orchestrator/engine, structured as a reusable library (`engine`) + thin CLI so the IDE plugin later embeds `engine` directly. Pipeline per save event: map file → Gradle module (from metadata json) → invoke that module's `compileDebugKotlin` via Gradle Tooling API → diff `.class` outputs against snapshot checksums → classify change (parse both class versions with ASM: body-only? additive? incompatible? group-key renumbering?) → D8 the changed classes (reusing the build's desugaring config) → send over ADB-forwarded socket → send invalidation keys (from FunctionKeyMeta of changed methods) → report status line. Incompatible changes: run `installDebug` instead, re-snapshot, continue watching.
5. **`intellij-plugin`** (Phase 5) — on-save/on-type triggers, status widget, error banners; wraps `engine`.

Plus **`samples/`** (single-module and multi-module demo apps) and **`e2e/`** (scripted emulator tests).

## Phases

### Phase 0 — De-risking spike (**hard — Fable/current session territory**)
Prove the full loop by hand on a toy Compose app (pin: latest stable Kotlin + Compose BOM + AGP; Pixel emulator API 34). No product code yet — a scratch repo and scripts.
1. Build debug APK with `generateFunctionKeyMetaAnnotations` enabled (verify the Compose compiler option name against the pinned compiler version; it has shifted names across versions — check `androidx.compose.compiler.plugins.kotlin.ComposeConfiguration`/CLI option list, and dump the emitted `FunctionKeyMeta` annotations from the APK dex to confirm key extraction works).
2. Write a minimal JVMTI agent (or build AOSP's) that redefines one class from bytes; attach via `Debug.attachJvmtiAgent` from a test Initializer; swap a composable body compiled out-of-band; call `invalidateGroupsWithKey` via reflection; observe UI update with `remember` state intact.
3. Repeat for: structural redefinition (add a new composable in the same file), a changed lambda (new-class path), and `HotReloader` reset tier.
4. **Exit criteria:** documented working recipe + list of every reflection call and compiler flag used, with the exact pinned versions. Everything after this is engineering, not research.

### Phase 1 — MVP vertical slice (single module, body edits) (**hard core, then Opus-friendly**)
- `agent`: port/trim AOSP native agent to a standalone NDK build (Fable: initial port; Opus: build system, JNI glue polish).
- `runtime-client`: startup init, agent attach, socket server, redefine path, `invalidateGroupsWithKey` shim for the pinned Compose version.
- `engine` + `cli`: file watcher (io.methvin.directory-watcher), Gradle Tooling API incremental compile, checksum differ, D8 invocation, ADB forward + protocol, happy-path classifier (body-only vs "anything else → tell user to rebuild").
- `gradle-plugin`: inject runtime-client into debug, set compiler flags, snapshot task, metadata json.
- **Exit criteria:** on `samples/single-module`, editing a composable body reflects on the emulator in <2s with state preserved, via `hotreload watch`.

### Phase 2 — Robustness & breadth (**Opus-executable with the matrix above as spec**)
- Structural additions (new composables/functions/fields) via structural redefinition; new-class/lambda path via `InMemoryDexClassLoader`.
- Full change classifier with ASM: detect signature/removal/inline/group-renumbering cases → automatic fallback to `installDebug` + re-snapshot + resume (HotSwan's "quiet fallback" UX).
- Three-tier invalidation chain with automatic escalation on recomposition exceptions (Compose catches and restores last-good state — hook `Recomposer` error callbacks / `HotReloader.getCurrentErrors`).
- Multi-module: per-module metadata, compile only the affected module, cross-module diff.
- Resource edits: run `processDebugResources`, push resource APK, swap via `ResourcesManager` (AOSP deployer has this code), tier-3 recreate when needed.

### Phase 3 — Literal fast path (**Opus-executable**)
Enable Compose `liveLiterals` in debug; engine detects constant-only edits by source-diffing before compiling (skip Gradle entirely); send `LiteralUpdate` keyed by the live-literal key. Sub-100ms loop. Guard behind a flag (live literals add debug overhead).

### Phase 4 — OSS hardening (**Opus-executable**)
Compose version shim matrix (N and N-1 stable Compose runtimes), AGP/Kotlin version checks with clear errors, docs site, publish plugin + AAR to Maven Central, CI (GitHub Actions + emulator e2e), telemetry-free diagnostics (`hotreload doctor`).

### Phase 5 — IntelliJ/Android Studio plugin (**Opus-executable**)
Embed `engine`; trigger on save; status bar widget (Ready / Reloading / Fallback-building / Error); gutter feedback; settings page. CLI remains supported.

### Phase 6 — Structural interpreter engine (v2 parity) (**hard — Fable territory; optional/stretch**)
For edits the classifier rejects (signature changes, removed members, inline functions, hierarchy edits): adopt Live Edit's Primer approach from AOSP — install trampolines that route affected method entries into an on-device **bytecode interpreter** (AOSP `LiveEditInterpreter`: ASM Frame + opcode interpreter; `invokespecial`/`monitorenter` via JNI) executing the *new* bytecode without asking ART to redefine anything. When the session ends or a real build lands, swap back to native DEX. This is HotSwan v2's breakthrough; ship Phases 1–5 first — the fallback-to-build UX is already good.

## Key risks & mitigations
- **Compose runtime internals are `internal` and shift between releases** → all reflection isolated in `ComposeVersionShim`; e2e matrix per supported Compose version; loud capability report at session start.
- **Compose compiler group-key renumbering** when edits add/remove groups can invalidate the key map → classifier compares emitted `FunctionKeyMeta` before/after; renumbering → fallback build (HotSwan does the same).
- **Kotlin incremental compilation traps** (inline functions inlined into other modules, default-arg synthetics, `const val` inlined at call sites) → classifier treats these as incompatible → fallback build.
- **ADB/agent flakiness, OEM ART quirks** → capability handshake (`Ping/Capabilities`) at attach; API 30+ floor; emulator-first support statement.
- **Licensing** — AOSP `tools/base/deploy` and JetBrains compose-hot-reload are Apache-2.0: adaptation is fine with NOTICE attribution; keep provenance headers on ported files.

## Verification (every phase)
- `samples/` apps exercised by `e2e/` harness on a CI emulator: script edits a source file, waits, asserts via `uiautomator dump`/screenshot diff that the UI changed **without process death** (assert same PID) and that a counter `remember` state survived. Add one e2e case per row of the change matrix as it's implemented.
- Phase 0/1 manual gate: sub-2s save→pixel latency on a M-series Mac + emulator.
