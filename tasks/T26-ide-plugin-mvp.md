# T26: IntelliJ/Android Studio plugin MVP (Phase 5)
Status: DONE (2026-07-06 — all 3 acceptance criteria verified live by the maintainer + Opus)
Assignee: agy (the maintainer for the runIde manual checks)
Priority: 6 of T21–T27

## Outcome (2026-07-05, Opus)
Implemented in `intellij-plugin/` (standalone build, mirrors runtime-client's wrapper). Files:
- `CliProtocol.kt` — pure, framework-free line→state machine (the ONLY engine coupling).
- `HotReloadService.kt` — spawns the CLI via `GeneralCommandLine`/`OSProcessHandler`, line-buffers
  stdout+stderr, folds through CliProtocol, balloons on Error/Rebuild.
- `HotReloadStatusWidget(+Factory).kt`, `HotReloadToggleAction.kt`, `HotReloadConfigurable.kt`,
  `HotReloadSettings.kt`, `plugin.xml`, `README.md`.
- Tests: `CliProtocolTest.kt` (JUnit5) + 6 transcript fixtures under `src/test/resources/fixtures/`.

**Parser verified LIVE offline (29/29 assertions)** by compiling CliProtocol + a harness with the
cached Kotlin 2.4.0 in a throwaway `--offline` gradle module — not just eyeballed. So the load-bearing
logic is proven; the IntelliJ glue could not be compiled here (needs the ~1GB IDE download / network).

**Spec vs reality — the guessed prefixes were wrong.** Spec said `swapped:`/`resource-swapped:`/
`injected:`; the engine actually emits `hot-swapped:` (no `injected:` line — injects fold into the
same `hot-swapped:` summary). Real prefixes used (from WatchSession.kt + ResourceSwapper.kt):
Ready=`watching `; Reloading=`changed: `; Ready(success)=`hot-swapped: `/`resource-swapped: `/
`literal-pushed: `/`no bytecode changes`; Rebuild=`cannot hot-swap: `/`resource set changed`/
`run a full install`; Error=`compile failed …`/`resource build failed …`/`recomposition failed: `/
`no debug APK under`/stderr `hotreload: `. No engine output was changed (out-of-scope respected).

**Residual API-drift risks (only surface at `buildPlugin`, one-line fixes each):** (1) status-bar
click uses `com.intellij.util.Consumer` — if the target platform wants `java.util.function.Consumer`,
swap the import; (2) `StatusBarWidgetFactory.createWidget(project)` single-arg overload; (3)
`platformVersion=2025.1` in gradle.properties — bump if unavailable. `2.5.0` IntelliJ-plugin version.

**Acceptance status:** #1 (`./gradlew test buildPlugin`) — GREEN (2026-07-06, Opus): 18 CliProtocol
tests pass, `hotreload-intellij-plugin-0.1.0.zip` produced. Two build-config fixes were needed once
the IDE deps actually resolved on the networked run: (a) dropped `testFramework(TestFrameworkType.
Platform)` — it registers `com.intellij.tests.JUnit5TestSessionListener` via META-INF/services which
cannot instantiate outside the full IDE test runtime; our CliProtocol test is pure JUnit5 and never
needed it; (b) added `testRuntimeOnly("junit:junit:4.13.2")` — the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin
still wires its JUnit4-based runtime into `:test`, so `org.junit.rules.TestRule` must be present.
#3 (root e2e unaffected) — TRUE, no root files touched. #2 (runIde manual) — GREEN (2026-07-06,
the maintainer live on emulator-5554): Start→Ready, body edit→Reloading→Ready + emulator updated, signature
change→Rebuild-needed, Stop→no leaked `dev.hotreload.cli.MainKt` process, Stop→widget `off`.
Two things surfaced and were fixed during the run (both committed): (1) the CLI launcher was built
before the T24 protocol-v6 bump → rebuilt via `:cli:installDist`; (2) a stale live-literals APK
desynced the slot table on first swap (ClassCastis String→MeasurePolicy in an UNEDITED composable)
→ fresh `installDebug` matching the non-`--literals` watch fixed it (see [[engine-baseline-dex-mismatch]]).
Also fixed a real plugin bug: Stop went through `destroyProcess()` (signal → non-zero exit) so the
widget showed `error(watch exited 143)` instead of `off`; added a `stopping` flag (commit 87cc160).

## Goal
Phase 5 MVP: hot reload without leaving the IDE. Decision (made, do not revisit): the plugin
does NOT embed the engine in-process — it **spawns the CLI** (`hotreload watch`) and parses its
stdout. Rationale: Gradle Tooling API + our classpath inside the IDE JVM is a known pain source;
the CLI's log lines are already the stable machine-readable surface we control, and the CLI
stays the single source of truth.

## Spec
1. New top-level `intellij-plugin/` Gradle project (IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin 2.x,
   `intellij { }` target = latest stable IntelliJ IDEA Community; do NOT target Android Studio
   specifically for the MVP — it runs there too). Own build like runtime-client (root project
   not touched); wire `runIde`, `buildPlugin`.
2. Plugin surface (keep it to exactly this):
   - **Settings** (project-level, persistent): project dir (default = project base path),
     app id, modules CSV, SDK path, extra CLI args. One settings page.
   - **Start/Stop action** (Tools menu + status-widget click): starts the CLI as a
     `GeneralCommandLine` process (`hotreload watch ...` — resolve the CLI via a configurable
     path to the repo's installDist for now), stops via destroying the process
     (the CLI's own shutdown already kills the session; verify no orphaned
     `dev.hotreload.cli.MainKt` after stop — same pkill contract as e2e).
   - **Status bar widget** with states: Off / Starting / Ready / Reloading / Error(n) /
     Rebuild-needed. Driven purely by parsing CLI stdout lines: the session-start banner →
     Ready; a save-triggered compile line → Reloading; `swapped:`/`resource-swapped:`/
     `injected:` → Ready (flash the latency from the line); `compose-error`/`error:` lines →
     Error with tooltip = first line; `rebuild required`/`reinstall required` → Rebuild-needed
     sticky until next successful swap. Read the exact line prefixes from
     `engine/.../WatchSession.kt` logging and list them in a `CliProtocol.kt` with unit tests
     against sample transcript fixtures (fixtures = copy real lines from an e2e watch log).
   - **Save integration**: none needed — the CLI's own file watcher handles saves. The plugin
     only ensures "save on frame deactivation" isn't required: document that autosave timing
     adds latency and recommend enabling explicit auto-save; do not hook typing events in MVP.
   - **Notifications**: one balloon on Error and on Rebuild-needed (with a "run build" hint);
     nothing else.
3. No gutter icons, no error banners in-editor, no auto-start, no bundled CLI binary in MVP.
4. Docs: `intellij-plugin/README.md` — build, install-from-disk, configure, known limits.

## Out of scope
- Publishing to JetBrains Marketplace; signing.
- Embedding engine classes; Gradle Tooling API from the IDE process.
- Android Studio-specific APIs (logcat panes, run configurations).
- Any change to engine/cli output format (if a needed line is missing/ambiguous, note it in the
  review notes instead of changing engine).

## Acceptance
1. `cd intellij-plugin && ./gradlew test buildPlugin` → green; plugin zip produced.
   `CliProtocol` unit tests cover every state transition from fixture lines.
2. `./gradlew runIde` manual script (the maintainer): open `samples/single-module`, configure, Start →
   widget Ready; edit `Counter.kt` body → widget flashes Reloading→Ready and the emulator
   updates (same PID via `scripts/ui-state.sh`); make a signature change → Rebuild-needed
   balloon; Stop → `pgrep -f dev.hotreload.cli.MainKt` empty.
3. Repo root `./e2e/run.sh` unaffected (no root-project changes).
